## These are my valuable notes I made at time of learning JavaScript.

we use let keyword for stating the value of any variable we use, and we use console.log() to present it further.

This is a camel case selection in this we are importing the value of the html in our javascript page by this 

```jsx
document.getElementById(”count-el”)
```

# DOM (Document Object Model )➖

it is a simple way by which we can use the html model in our JS file by creating a model of the real element.

## [What is JavaScript?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics#what_is_javascript)

[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript) is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.

JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!

JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include: 

- Browser Application Programming Interfaces ([APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/API)) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
- Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
- Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.

It's outside the scope of this article—as a light introduction to JavaScript—to present the details of how the core JavaScript language is different from the tools listed above. You can learn more in MDN's [JavaScript learning area](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript), as well as in other parts of MDN.

The section below introduces some aspects of the core language and offers an opportunity to play with a few browser API features too. Have fun!

## [A "Hello world!" example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics#a_hello_world!_example)

JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.

However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start small, and progress gradually. To begin, let's examine how to add JavaScript to your page for creating a *Hello world!* example. (*Hello world!* is [the standard for introductory programming examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program).)

**Warning:** If you haven't been following along with the rest of our course, [download this example code](https://codeload.github.com/mdn/beginner-html-site-styled/zip/refs/heads/gh-pages) and use it as a starting point.

1. Go to your test site and create a new folder named `scripts`. Within the scripts folder, create a new text document called `main.js`, and save it.
2. In your `index.html` file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing `</body>` tag:
    
    HTMLCopy to Clipboard
    
    ```html
    <script src="scripts/main.js"></script>
    ```
    
3. This is doing the same job as the `[<link>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link)` element for CSS. It applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).
4. Add this code to the `main.js` file:
    
    JSCopy to Clipboard
    
    ```jsx
    const myHeading = document.querySelector("h1");
    myHeading.textContent = "Hello world!";
    
    ```
    
5. Make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved. Then load `index.html` in your browser. You should see something like this:

!https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics/hello-world.png

**Note:** The reason the instructions (above) place the `[<script>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script)` element near the bottom of the HTML file is that **the browser reads code in the order it appears in the file**.

If the JavaScript loads first and it is supposed to affect the HTML that hasn't loaded yet, there could be problems. Placing JavaScript near the bottom of an HTML page is one way to accommodate this dependency. To learn more about alternative approaches, see [Script loading strategies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript#script_loading_strategies).

### [What happened?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics#what_happened)

The heading text changed to *Hello world!* using JavaScript. You did this by using a function called `[querySelector()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector)` to grab a reference to your heading, and then store it in a variable called `myHeading`. This is similar to what we did using CSS selectors. When you want to do something to an element, you need to select it first.

Following that, the code set the value of the `myHeading` variable's `[textContent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent)` property (which represents the content of the heading) to *Hello world!*.

**Note:** Both of the features you used in this exercise are parts of the [Document Object Model (DOM) API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model), which has the capability to manipulate documents.

# JavaScript Can Change HTML Content

One of many JavaScript HTML methods is `getElementById()`.

The example below "finds" an HTML element (with id="demo"), and changes the element content (innerHTML) to "Hello JavaScript":

```jsx
document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'Hello JavaScript';
```

JavaScript and [Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp) are completely different languages, both in concept and design.

JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.

ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.

# JavaScript Functions and Events

A JavaScript `function` is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.

For example, a function can be called when an **event** occurs, like when the user clicks a button.

Note ➖Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display.

There are 2 ways to include java script in a html one is internal java script and another is external java script 

internal java script uses <script> tags inside the body and head of our html Whereas extrnal javascript uses src tag to link to an another file containing the script.

# External JavaScript Advantages

Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

- It separates HTML and code
- It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
- Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads

# JavaScript Display Possibilities

JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

- Writing into an HTML element, using `innerHTML`.
- Writing into the HTML output using `document.write()`.
- Writing into an alert box, using `window.alert()`.
- Writing into the browser console, using `console.log()`.

# Using document.write()

For testing purposes, it is convenient to use `document.write()`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

<button type="button" onclick="document.write(5 + 6)">Try it</button>

</body>
</html>
```

# Using window.alert()

You can use an alert box to display data:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

<script>
window.alert(5 + 6);
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

You can skip the `window` keyword.

In JavaScript, the window object is the global scope object. This means that variables, properties, and methods by default belong to the window object. This also means that specifying the `window` keyword is optional:

# Using console.log()

For debugging purposes, you can call the `console.log()` method in the browser to display data.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<script>
console.log(5 + 6);
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

# JavaScript Programs

A **computer program** is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called **statements**.

A **JavaScript program** is a list of programming **statements**.

# JavaScript Keywords

JavaScript statements often start with a **keyword** to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

Our [Reserved Words Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp) lists all JavaScript keywords.

Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:

| Keyword | Description |
| --- | --- |
| var | Declares a variable |
| let | Declares a block variable |
| const | Declares a block constant |
| if | Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition |
| switch | Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases |
| for | Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop |
| function | Declares a function |
| return | Exits a function |
| try | Implements error handling to a block of statements |

JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables

# JavaScript is Case Sensitive

All JavaScript identifiers are **case sensitive**.

The variables `lastName` and `lastname`, are two different variables:

Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

JavaScript uses the **Unicode** character set.

# When to Use var, let, or const?

1. Always declare variables

2. Always use `const` if the value should not be changed

3. Always use `const` if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

4. Only use `let` if you can't use `const`

5. Only use `var` if you MUST support old browsers.

with let u can not redeclare variable but with the var u can redeclare the variable .

| Operator | Example | Same As |
| --- | --- | --- |
| = | x = y | x = y |
| += | x += y | x = x + y |
| -= | x -= y | x = x - y |
| *= | x *= y | x = x * y |
| /= | x /= y | x = x / y |
| %= | x %= y | x = x % y |
| **= | x **= y | x = x ** y |

# JavaScript has 8 Datatypes

1. String

2. Number

3. Bigint

4. Boolean

5. Undefined

6. Null

7. Symbol

8. Object

# The Object Datatype

The object data type can contain:

1. An object

2. An array

3. A date

```jsx
// Numbers:
let length = 16;
let weight = 7.5;

// Strings:
let color = "Yellow";
let lastName = "Johnson";

// Booleans
let x = true;
let y = false;

// Object:
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};

// Array object:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// Date object:
const date = new Date("2022-03-25");
```

## While using if else statement we can use a method of using an empty string and in this method we declare an empty string and change its value according to our requirements for ex :

```jsx
let firstCard = 10
let secondCard = 4
let sum = firstCard + secondCard
let hasBlackJack = false
let isAlive = true
let message = ""

if (sum <= 20) {
    message = "Do you want to draw a new card? 🙂"
} else if (sum === 21) {
    message = "Wohoo! You've got Blackjack! 🥳"
    hasBlackJack = true
} else {
    message = "You're out of the game! 😭"
    isAlive = false
} 

console.log(message)
```

In this we have declared a empty string and can further change its value by assigning it new values and can further call it .

## slice is a property of java script which is used to cute a line, sentence or a paragraph upto the length we require and its syntax is variable.slice(starting index of cutting  , final index upto we have to cut )

touppercase() this function is used to change a string from its lower case to its upper case 

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/789d10fc-6870-437b-b784-d2ec21bb17fb/0438d998-be2b-4150-b619-4612d008e514/Untitled.png)

## In javascript there are 2 types of data types 1) Primitive  2) Reference types or objects

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/789d10fc-6870-437b-b784-d2ec21bb17fb/73493f85-b938-4346-b37b-82db97126654/Untitled.png)

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/789d10fc-6870-437b-b784-d2ec21bb17fb/15cdd4fc-4d11-4427-8641-0227c092b30c/Untitled.png)

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/789d10fc-6870-437b-b784-d2ec21bb17fb/a5fbc641-950a-457d-90d6-e18762303234/Untitled.png)

## IF we want to convert any string into integer  we can use a function called parseInt() or by using a unary operator for example :

```jsx
let amount = '100';
amount = parseInt(amount); //using parse int method
amount = +aamount; //By using unary operaator 
amount = Number(amount);
 
//Change number to string 
amount = amount.toString(); 
```

The following are explanations of various string methods in JavaScript:

- `.toUpperCase()`: This method is used to convert a string to uppercase. For example, `"hello".toUpperCase()` will return `"HELLO"`.
- `.toLowerCase()`: This method is used to convert a string to lowercase. For example, `"HELLO".toLowerCase()` will return `"hello"`.
- `.charAt()`: This method is used to retrieve the character at a specified index in a string. The index starts at 0. For example, `"hello".charAt(1)` will return `"e"`.
- `.indexOf()`: This method is used to find the index of a specified substring within a string. It returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring, or -1 if the substring is not found. For example, `"hello".indexOf("l")` will return `2`.
- `.substring()`: This method is used to extract a portion of a string between two specified indices. The extracted characters include the character at the starting index but exclude the character at the ending index. For example, `"hello".substring(1, 4)` will return `"ell"`.
- `.slice()`: This method is similar to `.substring()` and is used to extract a portion of a string between two specified indices. The extracted characters include the character at the starting index but exclude the character at the ending index. It can also accept negative indices, which count from the end of the string. For example, `"hello".slice(1, 4)` will return `"ell"`.

## Math functions ➖

This a very useful function used to do many mathematical operations such as ➖

Here are some of the most commonly used Math functions in JavaScript:

- `Math.round(x)`: Returns the value of x rounded to the nearest integer.
- `Math.ceil(x)`: Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.
- `Math.floor(x)`: Returns the largest integer less than or equal to x.
- `Math.abs(x)`: Returns the absolute value of x.
- `Math.max(x, y, z, ...)`: Returns the largest value among the given numbers.
- `Math.min(x, y, z, ...)`: Returns the smallest value among the given numbers.
- `Math.random()`: Returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
- `Math.pow(x, y)`: Returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
- `Math.sqrt(x)`: Returns the square root of x.
- `Math.floor(Math.random() * n)`: Returns a random integer between 0 (inclusive) and n (exclusive).

These are just some of the many Math functions available in JavaScript. They can be used to perform various mathematical operations in your JavaScript code.

The `Date` object in JavaScript is used to work with dates and times. It allows you to create, manipulate, and format dates.

To create a new `Date` object, you can use the `new Date()` constructor. By default, it creates a `Date` object that represents the current date and time.

Here's an example of creating a `Date` object:

```jsx
const currentDate = new Date();

```

You can also create a `Date` object by specifying a specific date and time. You can pass arguments to the `Date` constructor to specify the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond.

Here's an example of creating a `Date` object with a specific date and time:

```jsx
const specificDate = new Date(2022, 2, 15, 10, 30, 0, 0);

```

Once you have a `Date` object, you can perform various operations on it. Some commonly used methods of the `Date` object include:

- `getFullYear()`: Returns the year of the date.
- `getMonth()`: Returns the month (0-11) of the date.
- `getDate()`: Returns the day of the month (1-31) of the date.
- `getDay()`: Returns the day of the week (0-6) of the date, where Sunday is 0 and Saturday is 6.
- `getHours()`: Returns the hour (0-23) of the date.
- `getMinutes()`: Returns the minutes (0-59) of the date.
- `getSeconds()`: Returns the seconds (0-59) of the date.
- `getMilliseconds()`: Returns the milliseconds (0-999) of the date.

You can also perform operations like adding or subtracting days, months, or years from a `Date` object using methods like `setDate()`, `setMonth()`, and `setFullYear()`.

Formatting dates in JavaScript can be done using a combination of the above methods and string concatenation or template literals.

Remember that JavaScript's `Date` object uses zero-based indexing for months, where January is 0 and December is 11.

This is just a brief overview of the `Date` object in JavaScript. For more detailed information and advanced usage, you can refer to the [MDN documentation on the Date object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date).

# Arrays in JavaScript➖

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/789d10fc-6870-437b-b784-d2ec21bb17fb/b27dae8e-1447-4b8c-8ee8-00280454d495/Untitled.png)

Array concatenation➖ **Array Concatenation**: The **`concat`** method is often used with arrays to concatenate two or more arrays together, creating a new array that combines the elements of the original arrays without modifying the original arrays. Here's an example

```jsx
const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
const array2 = [4, 5, 6];
const concatenatedArray = array1.concat(array2);
console.log(concatenatedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 

```

The spread operator is a powerful feature in JavaScript that allows us to expand elements from an array or object. It is denoted by three dots (`...`) and can be used in various contexts.

When used with arrays, the spread operator can be used to create a new array by combining the elements of existing arrays. It effectively "spreads" the elements of an array into a new array. Here's an example:

```jsx
const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
const array2 = [4, 5, 6];
const combinedArray = [...array1, ...array2];
console.log(combinedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

```

The spread operator can also be used to make a copy of an array. This is useful when you want to modify or manipulate an array without affecting the original array. Here's an example:

```jsx
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
const copiedArray = [...originalArray];
copiedArray.push(4);
console.log(originalArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
console.log(copiedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

```

In addition to arrays, the spread operator can also be used with objects. When used with objects, it can be used to create a new object by merging the properties of existing objects. Here's an example:

```jsx
const object1 = { name: "John" };
const object2 = { age: 25 };
const mergedObject = { ...object1, ...object2 };
console.log(mergedObject); // Output: { name: "John", age: 25 }

```

Now let's talk about flattening arrays. Flattening an array means converting a nested array into a single-level array. This can be achieved using the spread operator and the `concat()` method. Here's an example:

```jsx
const nestedArray = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]];
const flattenedArray = [].concat(...nestedArray);
console.log(flattenedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

```

In this example, the spread operator is used to spread the nested arrays, and then the `concat()` method is used to concatenate the spread elements into a new array.

Flattening arrays can also be achieved using the `reduce()` method or recursion, but using the spread operator and `concat()` method is a simple and effective approach.

Overall, the spread operator is a versatile tool in JavaScript that allows us to work with arrays and objects in a more concise and flexible way.

Here are some commonly used array operations in JavaScript:

- `arr.reverse()`: Reverses the order of elements in the array.
- `arr.unshift(element1, element2, ..., elementN)`: Adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array and returns the new length of the array.
- `arr.shift()`: Removes the first element from the array and returns that element.
- `arr.push(element1, element2, ..., elementN)`: Adds one or more elements to the end of the array and returns the new length of the array.
- `arr.pop()`: Removes the last element from the array and returns that element.
- `arr.concat(array2, array3, ..., arrayN)`: Returns a new array that combines the elements of the original array with the elements of one or more arrays.
- `arr.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ..., itemN)`: Changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.
- `arr.slice(start, end)`: Returns a new array containing a portion of the original array, starting from the specified start index and ending before the specified end index.
- `arr.join(separator)`: Joins all elements of an array into a string, separated by the specified separator.
- `arr.indexOf(element, fromIndex)`: Returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.
- `arr.lastIndexOf(element, fromIndex)`: Returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.

These are just a few examples of array operations in JavaScript. There are many more methods and functionalities available for working with arrays in JavaScript.

## Object Literal ➖

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/789d10fc-6870-437b-b784-d2ec21bb17fb/7209adce-61a3-455c-a32e-2f8efbb0a368/Untitled.png)

In simple language this is what a object literal is 

```jsx
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30,
  isEmployed: true,
};
```

- **`person`** is the name of the object.
- **`firstName`**, **`lastName`**, **`age`**, and **`isEmployed`** are properties of the object.
- **`"John"`**, **`"Doe"`**, **`30`**, and **`true`** are the respective values associated with these properties

You can access the properties of an object using dot notation or bracket notation. For example:

```jsx
console.log(person.firstName); // Output: "John"
console.log(person['lastName']); // Output: "Doe"
```

### Object spread operator ➖

Imagine you have two objects in JavaScript, and you want to create a new object that combines the properties of both. This is where the object spread operator comes in.

```jsx
const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 30,
};

const address = {
  city: 'Wonderland',
  zip: '12345',
};
```

```jsx
const combinedInfo = { ...person, ...address };
```

```jsx
{
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 30,
  city: 'Wonderland',
  zip: '12345',
}
```

The following are some commonly used methods and operations for working with objects in JavaScript:

1. `Object.keys(obj)`: Returns an array containing the keys of the specified object.

```jsx
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 5, favoriteColor: "Blue" };
const keys = Object.keys(person);
console.log(keys); // Output: [ 'name', 'age', 'favoriteColor' ]
```

1. `Object.values(obj)`: Returns an array containing the values of the specified object.

```jsx
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 5, favoriteColor: "Blue" };
const values = Object.values(person);
console.log(values); // Output: [ 'Alice', 5, 'Blue' ]
```

1. `Object.entries(obj)`: Returns an array containing arrays of key-value pairs of the specified object.

```jsx
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 5, favoriteColor: "Blue" };
const entries = Object.entries(person);
console.log(entries);
// Output: [ [ 'name', 'Alice' ], [ 'age', 5 ], [ 'favoriteColor', 'Blue' ] ]
```

1. `Object.assign(target, source)`: Copies the values of all enumerable properties from one or more source objects to a target object.

```jsx
const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const source = { b: 3, c: 4 };
Object.assign(target, source);
console.log(target); // Output: { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }
```

1. `Object.hasOwnProperty(prop)`: Returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property as a direct property of itself (not inherited).

```jsx
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 5 };
console.log(person.hasOwnProperty("name")); // Output: true
console.log(person.hasOwnProperty("gender")); // Output: false
```

1. `Object.freeze(obj)`: Freezes an object, preventing new properties from being added to it and existing properties from being modified or deleted.

```jsx
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 5 };
Object.freeze(person);
person.age = 6; // This won't change the object.
console.log(person); // Output: { name: 'Alice', age: 5 }
```

1. `Object.seal(obj)`: Seals an object, preventing new properties from being added to it and marking all existing properties as non-configurable.

```jsx
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 5 };
Object.seal(person);
person.gender = "Female"; // You can't add a new property.
delete person.age; // You can't delete properties.
```

1. `Object.is(obj1, obj2)`: Determines whether two values are the same value.

```jsx
console.log(Object.is(5, 5)); // Output: true
console.log(Object.is(0, -0)); // Output: false
```

1. `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)`: Returns an array containing the names of all properties (including non-enumerable properties) of the specified object.

```jsx
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 5 };
const propertyNames = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(person);
console.log(propertyNames); // Output: [ 'name', 'age' ]
```

1. `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)`: Returns the prototype (i.e., the internal `[[Prototype]]` property) of the specified object.

```jsx
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 5 };
const proto = Object.getPrototypeOf(person);
console.log(proto); // Output: {}
```

1. `Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, prototype)`: Sets the prototype (i.e., the internal `[[Prototype]]` property) of the specified object.

```jsx
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 5 };
const newProto = { gender: "Female" };
Object.setPrototypeOf(person, newProto);
console.log(person.gender); // Output: "Female"
```

These methods can be used to perform various operations on objects, such as iterating over object properties, copying object properties, checking property existence, and manipulating object prototypes.

Note that some methods, such as `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)`, may not return properties that are inherited from the prototype chain. To iterate over all properties, including inherited ones, you can use a combination of `Object.keys(obj)` and the `for...in` loop.

For more detailed information and examples, you can refer to the [MDN documentation on objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects).

## Destruction and Naming ➖

1. **Destructuring**:
    
    Destructuring is a cool trick in JavaScript that allows you to easily extract values from objects or arrays and assign them to variables. It's like unpacking a gift box with multiple smaller boxes inside.
    
    - **Object Destructuring**: Imagine you have an object, which is like a container with different items. You can use destructuring to pick out and name the items you're interested in.
    
    ```jsx
    javascriptCopy code
    const person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
    
    // Destructuring to extract values from the object
    const { name, age } = person;
    
    console.log(name); // Output: "Alice"
    console.log(age);  // Output: 25
    
    ```
    
    - **Array Destructuring**: It works similarly with arrays. You can extract elements from an array and give them names.
    
    ```jsx
    javascriptCopy code
    const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
    
    // Destructuring to extract values from the array
    const [firstColor, secondColor, thirdColor] = colors;
    
    console.log(firstColor);  // Output: "red"
    console.log(secondColor); // Output: "green"
    console.log(thirdColor);  // Output: "blue"
    
    ```
    
    Destructuring makes it easier to work with the specific pieces of data you need from objects and arrays.
    
2. **Naming**:
    
    In JavaScript, "naming" refers to how you give names to your variables. Think of variables as containers that store information. Names are like labels on those containers, making it easier to remember and use the stored information.
    
    - **Variable Names**: Variable names are usually chosen to be meaningful and related to the data they store. For example, if you have a variable to store a person's age, you can name it **`personAge`** to make it clear what it represents.
    
    ```jsx
    javascriptCopy code
    const personAge = 30; // "personAge" is the name of the variable.
    
    ```
    
    - **Function Names**: When you create functions, you give them names too. Function names should describe what the function does. For example:
    
    ```jsx
    function calculateSum(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    }
    
    ```
    
    In this function, **`calculateSum`** is the name you gave to describe that it calculates the sum of two numbers.
    
    Good naming helps you and other developers understand your code, making it easier to work with and maintain.
    

# Intro to JSON ➖

JSON, which stands for "JavaScript Object Notation," is a lightweight data interchange format used to store and exchange data between a server and a client, or between different parts of an application. It's a text-based format that is easy for both humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate.

Here's an explanation of JSON in beginner-friendly terms:

**1. JSON Structure:**

- JSON uses a simple and consistent structure: key-value pairs.
- Keys are strings enclosed in double quotes, followed by a colon. For example, **`"name":`**.
- Values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or **`null`**.

**2. JSON Example:**
JSON data might look like this:

```json
jsonCopy code
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 30,
  "isStudent": false,
  "hobbies": ["Reading", "Gardening"],
  "address": {
    "city": "Wonderland",
    "zip": "12345"
  }
}

```

In this example, we have a JSON object with various key-value pairs, including strings, numbers, an array, and another nested object.

**3. Why We Use JSON:**

- JSON is used for data exchange and storage because it's easy to read and write by both humans and machines.
- It's language-independent, meaning you can use it with any programming language.
- It's often used in web development for APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to send and receive data.

**4. How JSON Works:**

- JSON data can be converted to and from JavaScript objects using the **`JSON.parse()`** and **`JSON.stringify()`** methods.
- **`JSON.parse()`** takes a JSON string and converts it into a JavaScript object.
- **`JSON.stringify()`** takes a JavaScript object and converts it into a JSON string.

Example:

```jsx
javascriptCopy code
const jsonString = '{"name": "Bob", "age": 25}';
const jsonObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);
const jsonString2 = JSON.stringify(jsonObject);

```

**`jsonObject`** will be a JavaScript object, and **`jsonString2`** will be a JSON string.

**5. Uses of JSON:**

- JSON is commonly used for data transmission between a web server and a web client, making it fundamental for web development. For example, when a web application fetches data from a server, the server often sends it in JSON format.
- Configuration files for applications are often stored in JSON because of its simplicity and readability.
- JSON is used for storing and transferring structured data in various contexts, including databases and data storage systems.

In summary, JSON is a widely used data format for structuring and exchanging information. Its simplicity, compatibility with different programming languages, and ease of use make it a go-to choice for many applications, especially in web development. It's like a universal language for sharing and understanding data between different parts of an application or even between different systems.

**1. What is an Object?**

An object in JavaScript is a container for data (properties) and functions (methods). You can think of it as a real-world object like a car, with characteristics (properties) like color, model, and speed, and actions (methods) like starting the engine and accelerating

**2. Creating Objects:**
There are several ways to create objects in JavaScript:

- **Object Literal:** The simplest way to create an object is by using curly braces **`{}`** and specifying properties and methods inside.

```jsx
const car = {
    make: 'Toyota',
    model: 'Camry',
    year: 2022,
    start: function() {
        console.log('Engine started');
    }
};
```

By using Constructor :

**Constructor Function:** You can create objects using constructor functions, which are like templates for creating similar objects.

```jsx
function Car(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
    this.start = function() {
        console.log('Engine started');
    };
}

const myCar = new Car('Honda', 'Civic', 2021);
```

# Intro to Functions, Scope & Execution Context

**1. Function Declarations:**

Function declarations define a named function that can be called anywhere in your code.

```jsx
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

// Calling the function
greet('Alice'); // Outputs: "Hello, Alice!"

```

- The **`function`** keyword is used to declare a function.
- **`greet`** is the function name.
- **`(name)`** represents the parameter(s) the function accepts.
- The function's code is enclosed in curly braces **`{}`**.

## Function parameters and arguments :

### **A function parameter is a named variable used to import arguments into a function.**

for ex:

```jsx
function formatNumber(num) {
  return num.toFixed(2);
}

formatNumber(2);
```

In this example, the `num` variable is called the function's *parameter*: it's declared in the parenthesis-enclosed list of the function's definition. The function expects the `num` parameter to be a number — although this is not enforceable in JavaScript without writing runtime validation code. In the `formatNumber(2)` call, the number `2` is the function's *argument*: it's the value that is actually passed to the function in the function call. The argument value can be accessed inside the function body through the corresponding parameter name or the `[arguments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments)` object.

Arguments are always *[passed by value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_reference)* and never *passed by reference*. This means that if a function reassigns a parameter, the value won't change outside the function. More precisely, object arguments are *[passed by sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_sharing)*, which means if the object's properties are mutated, the change will impact the outside of the function.

```jsx
function updateBrand(obj) {
  // Mutating the object is visible outside the function
  obj.brand = "Toyota";
  // Try to reassign the parameter, but this won't affect
  // the variable's value outside the function
  obj = null;
}

const car = {
  brand: "Honda",
  model: "Accord",
  year: 1998,
};

console.log(car.brand); // Honda

// Pass object reference to the function
updateBrand(car);

// updateBrand mutates car
console.log(car.brand); // Toyota
```

## Scoping in JavaScript➖

### **1. Global Scope:**

- **What is it?**
    - The global scope in JavaScript refers to the outermost level of your code, outside of any function or block.
    - Variables declared in the global scope are accessible throughout the entire script.
- **Example:**
    
    ```jsx
    javascriptCopy code
    // Variable in the global scope
    let globalVariable = 'I am global!';
    
    function exampleFunction() {
        console.log(globalVariable); // Accessible within the function
    }
    
    console.log(globalVariable); // Accessible outside any function
    
    ```
    
- **Key Points:**
    - Variables declared without the **`var`**, **`let`**, or **`const`** keyword become global automatically.
    - Be cautious about global variables as they can be accessed and modified from anywhere in your code, which might lead to unintended consequences.

### **2. Function Scope:**

- **What is it?**
    - Function scope refers to the visibility of variables within a specific function.
    - Variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function.
- **Example:**
    
    ```jsx
    javascriptCopy code
    function exampleFunction() {
        // Variable in the function scope
        let localVariable = 'I am local!';
        console.log(localVariable); // Accessible within the function
    }
    
    exampleFunction();
    // console.log(localVariable); // Error! 'localVariable' is not defined outside the function
    
    ```
    
- **Key Points:**
    - Variables declared using **`var`** are function-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the function in which they are defined.
    - Variables declared with **`let`** and **`const`** have block scope, which means they are limited to the block (a set of curly braces) where they are defined, including functions.

### **3. Block Scope (Modern JavaScript):**

- **What is it?**
    - With the introduction of **`let`** and **`const`** in modern JavaScript, block scope is more prevalent.
    - Block scope means variables are limited to the block (the area between curly braces **`{}`**), not just functions.
- **Example:**
    
    ```jsx
    javascriptCopy code
    if (true) {
        // Variable in block scope
        let blockVariable = 'I am in a block!';
        console.log(blockVariable); // Accessible within the block
    }
    
    // console.log(blockVariable); // Error! 'blockVariable' is not defined outside the block
    
    ```
    
- **Key Points:**
    - Use **`let`** and **`const`** for block-scoped variables.
    - This helps prevent unintended variable access and modification.

### **Summary:**

- **Global Scope:**
    - Outermost level of your code.
    - Variables are accessible throughout the entire script.
    - Beware of unintended global variables.
- **Function Scope:**
    - Refers to the visibility of variables within a specific function.
    - Variables are only accessible within the function where they are defined.
    - Applies to variables declared using **`var`**.
- **Block Scope (Modern JavaScript):**
    - Variables are limited to the block where they are defined (including functions).
    - Use **`let`** and **`const`** for block-scoped variables.

### Arrow Function ➖

an arrow function is used for making the function look more simple the basic syntax of an arrow function is ➖

```jsx
const add = (a,b) => a + b;
console.log(add(4,5));
```

## IFFE ➖

An IIFE, which stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression, is a JavaScript design pattern used to create a self-contained scope for a block of code and execute it immediately after its creation. This helps in avoiding variable hoisting and creating private variables. Let's break down the components and purpose of an IIFE:

### **Basic Syntax:**

```jsx
(function() {
    // Your code here
})();
```

- The entire function is wrapped in parentheses **`( )`** to make it a function expression.
- The trailing **`( )`** immediately invokes (calls) the function.

### **Purpose:**

1. **Encapsulation:**
    - An IIFE creates a private scope for the enclosed code, preventing variables from polluting the global scope.
    - Variables declared inside the IIFE are not accessible from outside, providing a form of encapsulation.
2. **Avoiding Variable Hoisting:**
    - Variables declared inside an IIFE are not hoisted to the global scope or outer scopes.
    - This helps in avoiding unintended interactions or overwrites of variables.

### **Example:**

```jsx
javascriptCopy code
(function() {
    var localVar = 'I am a local variable';
    console.log(localVar); // Accessible inside the IIFE
})();

// console.log(localVar); // Error! 'localVar' is not defined outside the IIFE

```

- **`localVar`** is local to the IIFE and cannot be accessed outside of it.

### **Passing Parameters:**

You can pass parameters to an IIFE in the following way:

```jsx
javascriptCopy code
(function(x, y) {
    console.log(x + y);
})(5, 10); // Outputs: 15

```

### **Use Cases:**

1. **Avoiding Global Pollution:**
    - When you want to avoid creating global variables.
2. **Module Pattern:**
    - Used to create modules with private variables and functions.
3. **Temporary Scope:**
    - When a temporary scope is needed for a specific operation.

### **Modern JavaScript:**

With the advent of block-scoped variables (**`let`** and **`const`**) in ES6, the need for IIFE has diminished in some cases. Block-scoped variables provide similar encapsulation without the need for an IIFE. However, IIFE remains a useful pattern in various scenarios, especially in environments where ES6 features might not be fully supported.

### **Execution Context:**

An execution context is like the environment or the set of rules in which your JavaScript code runs. It keeps track of the variables, functions, and the scope of your code. When you run your code, it's not just executed randomly; it happens within a specific context.

### **Three Types of Execution Contexts:**

1. **Global Execution Context:**
    - The outermost context.
    - Represents the environment in which your code is executed globally.
    - Anything declared outside of functions or blocks belongs to the global context.
    
    ```jsx
    javascriptCopy code
    // Example in the global context
    const globalVariable = 'I am global!';
    
    ```
    
2. **Function Execution Context:**
    - Created when a function is invoked (called).
    - Each function call creates a new execution context.
    - It has its own set of variables and a reference to the outer (enclosing) context.
    
    ```jsx
    javascriptCopy code
    function exampleFunction() {
        const localVariable = 'I am local!';
    }
    
    ```
    
3. **Eval Execution Context (Rarely Used):**
    - Created when the **`eval()`** function is executed.
    - **`eval()`** is not commonly used due to security and performance concerns.

### **The Call Stack:**

- Execution contexts are managed using a data structure called the "call stack."
- When a function is called, a new execution context is added to the top of the stack.
- When the function completes, its context is removed from the stack.

### **Scope Chain:**

- Each execution context has a reference to its outer (enclosing) context, forming a chain known as the "scope chain."
- This chain allows functions to access variables from their own scope, as well as from the outer scopes.

### **Example:**

```jsx
javascriptCopy code
const globalVar = 'I am global!';

function outerFunction() {
    const outerVar = 'I am outer!';

    function innerFunction() {
        const innerVar = 'I am inner!';
        console.log(globalVar); // Accessible from the global context
        console.log(outerVar); // Accessible from the outer context
        console.log(innerVar); // Accessible in the current context
    }

    innerFunction();
}

outerFunction();

```

- In this example, there are three execution contexts: global, outerFunction, and innerFunction.
- Each context has access to variables in its own scope and the outer scopes.

## Logical operators➖

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/789d10fc-6870-437b-b784-d2ec21bb17fb/90bdc2fa-4995-471c-b1a3-aafff240140b/Untitled.png)

In this by using a ternary operator we are explaining that if age is not equal to or greater than 18 than you can vote else you can’t vote and here the : is known as scope resolution operator it works as an else 

## for each function ➖

```jsx
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

numbers.forEach(function(number, index) {
    console.log(`Element at index ${index}: ${number}`);
});
```

```jsx
Element at index 0: 1
Element at index 1: 2
Element at index 2: 3
Element at index 3: 4
```

In this we are assigning an index for each elements in an array to get access of each element of an array its advantage is it makes the code more readable and easy to understand .

By using arrow function 

```jsx
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

numbers.forEach((number, index) => {
    console.log(`Element at index ${index}: ${number}`);
});
```

## [Aarray.Map](http://Aarray.Map) () ➖

In this function we transform the old array into a new array and present it in new form . for ex

```jsx
const originalToys = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const coolerToys = originalToys.map(function(toy) {
    return toy * 2;  // Make each toy double cooler!
});

console.log(coolerToys);  // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

# DOM ➖

Dom is programming interface for web elements 

structure that we can interact with via javascript 

includes tags , attributes , text nodes , etc.

represented as a tree structure,

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/789d10fc-6870-437b-b784-d2ec21bb17fb/d80faa9d-9e2b-49ac-a0df-679208269d60/Untitled.png)

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a lot more exciting than it may sound at first. This is a fundamental concept you will need to understand before working with JavaScript on web pages. It grabs an HTML page and turns it into a logical tree.

## The BOM ➖

The BOM, sometimes also called the window browser object, is the amazing "magic" element that makes it possible for your JavaScript code to communicate with the browser.

## DOM selectors➖

In JavaScript, DOM selectors are methods that allow you to access and manipulate HTML elements. There are several ways to select elements in the DOM. Here are the primary methods:

1. **`getElementById`:**
    - Selects a single element by its unique **`id`** attribute.
    
    ```jsx
    javascriptCopy code
    const element = document.getElementById("myElementId");
    
    ```
    
2. **`getElementsByClassName`:**
    - Selects multiple elements by their shared **`class`** attribute.
    
    ```jsx
    javascriptCopy code
    const elements = document.getElementsByClassName("myClassName");
    
    ```
    
3. **`getElementsByTagName`:**
    - Selects elements by their HTML tag name.
    
    ```jsx
    javascriptCopy code
    const elements = document.getElementsByTagName("div");
    
    ```
    
4. **`getElementsByName`:**
    - Selects elements by their **`name`** attribute.
    
    ```jsx
    javascriptCopy code
    const elements = document.getElementsByName("myElementName");
    
    ```
    
5. **`querySelector`:**
    - Selects the first element that matches a specified CSS selector.
    
    ```jsx
    javascriptCopy code
    const element = document.querySelector("#myElementId");
    
    ```
    
6. **`querySelectorAll`:**
    - Selects all elements that match a specified CSS selector.
    
    ```jsx
    javascriptCopy code
    const elements = document.querySelectorAll(".myClassName");
    
    ```
    
7. **`querySelector` and `querySelectorAll` with Attribute Selectors:**
    - You can also use attribute selectors.
    
    ```jsx
    javascriptCopy code
    const element = document.querySelector('[data-custom="example"]');
    const elements = document.querySelectorAll('[data-custom="example"]');
    
    ```
    

These selectors provide various ways to access elements in the DOM based on their attributes, tags, classes, and more. Choose the selector that best fits your needs depending on the structure of your HTML document and the specific elements you want to target. Keep in mind that **`querySelector`** and **`querySelectorAll`** are more versatile as they allow you to use CSS-like selectors.

In javascript you can use these selectors for selecting or accessing html elements

## How to insert an element in DOM

To insert an element into the DOM (Document Object Model), you can use various methods provided by the DOM API. Here are a few common methods to insert elements:

### **1. `appendChild`:**

- Adds a new child node to the end of the list of children of a specified parent node.

```jsx
javascriptCopy code
const parentElement = document.getElementById("parentElementId");
const newElement = document.createElement("div");
newElement.textContent = "This is a new element!";
parentElement.appendChild(newElement);

```

### **2. `insertBefore`:**

- Inserts a node before a specified reference node as a child of a specified parent node.

```jsx
javascriptCopy code
const parentElement = document.getElementById("parentElementId");
const referenceElement = document.getElementById("referenceElementId");
const newElement = document.createElement("div");
newElement.textContent = "This is a new element!";
parentElement.insertBefore(newElement, referenceElement);

```

### **3. `insertAdjacentHTML`:**

- Inserts HTML into a specified position relative to the element.

```jsx
javascriptCopy code
const parentElement = document.getElementById("parentElementId");
parentElement.insertAdjacentHTML("beforeend", "<div>This is a new element!</div>");

```

The second argument to **`insertAdjacentHTML`** specifies the HTML to be inserted, and the first argument specifies the position:

- **`"beforebegin"`**: Before the element itself.
- **`"afterbegin"`**: Just inside the element, before its first child.
- **`"beforeend"`**: Just inside the element, after its last child.
- **`"afterend"`**: After the element itself.

### **4. `innerHTML`:**

- Directly sets the HTML content of an element. Be cautious with this method, as it can introduce security risks if used with user-generated content.

```jsx
javascriptCopy code
const parentElement = document.getElementById("parentElementId");
parentElement.innerHTML += "<div>This is a new element!</div>";

```

Choose the method that best fits your needs based on the context and the position where you want to insert the new element. Always be mindful of potential security issues, especially when dealing with user-generated content.

### QuerySelector ➖

In JavaScript, the **`querySelector`** method is used to select the first element that matches a specified CSS selector within the document. It's part of the DOM (Document Object Model) API and provides a convenient way to access and manipulate elements on a webpage.

### **Syntax:**

```jsx
javascriptCopy code
const element = document.querySelector(selector);

```

### **Parameters:**

- **`selector`:** A string representing a CSS selector that specifies the type of element(s) to select.

### **How `querySelector` Works:**

1. **Selection:**
    - **`querySelector`** scans the document, starting from the element on which it is called (usually **`document`**), looking for the first element that matches the provided CSS selector.
2. **Matching:**
    - It matches the selector against the elements in the DOM and returns the first match.
3. **Result:**
    - If a matching element is found, **`querySelector`** returns a reference to that element; otherwise, it returns **`null`**.

### **Example:**

Let's say you have the following HTML structure:

```html
htmlCopy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>querySelector Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="container">
    <p class="highlight">This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
  </div>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

```

You can use **`querySelector`** to select and manipulate elements in JavaScript:

```jsx
javascriptCopy code
// Select the first paragraph with class "highlight"
const highlightedParagraph = document.querySelector('.highlight');

// Change the text content of the selected paragraph
highlightedParagraph.textContent = 'This paragraph is now highlighted!';

```

In this example, **`querySelector('.highlight')`** selects the first element with the class "highlight" (the first **`<p>`** element), and then the text content of that paragraph is updated.

### **Advantages of `querySelector`:**

1. **CSS-like Syntax:**
    - The syntax is similar to CSS, making it familiar and easy to use.
2. **Powerful Selectors:**
    - You can use complex CSS selectors, enabling you to target specific elements in a flexible way.
3. **Single Element Selection:**
    - It returns only the first matching element, which can be useful when you expect only one match.
4. **Compatibility:**
    - It is widely supported across modern browsers.

Keep in mind that **`querySelector`** returns only the first matching element. If you need to select multiple elements, you can use **`querySelectorAll`**.

# Events in javascript ➖

we use many events in javascript but nowadays we use a method which involves extracting element from id or class then using a property called addevent listeners which can run a function on many events related to out mouse click or keyboard for example:

```jsx
document.getElementById('main-heading').addEventListener('click', function(){
    alert("WELCOME MASTER VINEET SOMANI AKA DXFURYMAN");
});
```

in this code we use click event and pop up a message on click of the mouse 

what is event propogation➖ The events or series of events your script is tracking from inside to outside and is known as bubbling and capturing is done through top to bottom the event which is listed in first will occur first in capturing

## You can revise more by github chai aur code repository i have made two projects by using async .

In JavaScript, **`setTimeout`**, **`setInterval`**, and **`clearInterval`** are functions used for handling asynchronous code execution and controlling the timing of certain operations. Let's look at each of them:

1. **`setTimeout`:**
    - **`setTimeout`** is a function that allows you to schedule the execution of a function or a piece of code after a specified delay (in milliseconds).
    - It takes two parameters: a function or a code snippet to be executed and the delay in milliseconds.
    - Example:
        
        ```jsx
        javascriptCopy code
        setTimeout(function() {
            console.log("Delayed execution after 2000 milliseconds");
        }, 2000);
        
        ```
        
    - In the example above, the provided function will be executed after a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds).
2. **`setInterval`:**
    - **`setInterval`** is similar to **`setTimeout`**, but it repeatedly executes a function or a code snippet at specified intervals.
    - It also takes two parameters: a function or code snippet to be executed and the interval in milliseconds.
    - Example:
        
        ```jsx
        javascriptCopy code
        let counter = 0;
        const intervalId = setInterval(function() {
            console.log("Interval execution #" + counter);
            counter++;
        }, 1000);
        
        ```
        
    - In the example above, the provided function will be executed every 1000 milliseconds (1 second), and the interval ID is stored in the variable **`intervalId`**.
3. **`clearInterval`:**
    - **`clearInterval`** is used to stop the execution of a function that was previously started with **`setInterval`**.
    - It takes the interval ID returned by **`setInterval`** as its parameter.
    - Example:
        
        ```jsx
        javascriptCopy code
        clearInterval(intervalId);
        
        ```
        
    - In the example above, the **`clearInterval`** function stops the execution of the function that was set to run at intervals. The **`intervalId`** is the identifier returned by the **`setInterval`** function.

These functions are commonly used in scenarios where you need to introduce delays, perform periodic tasks, or create animations in web development. It's important to note that these functions operate asynchronously, allowing other code to continue running while waiting for the specified time to elapse.
